# DIY Neural Networks For Funsies

_toy implementations of common machine learning concepts_

I get inspired from time to time to build the tools I use from scratch. I have been building NNs for a couple years but have not yet built all the underlying machinery.

I also get inspired to talk about the different things I've learned. This project will also be home to simple implementations of concepts that come up in conversation but are difficult to explain without having code to play with.
